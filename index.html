        <h3>About This CWSS</h3>
        <p>I have created a website exclusively for college students,
        specifically for my classmates. The purpose of this website
        is to facilitate the sharing of homework assignments among
        students once the class is over. To access the website, students
        need to log in using their credentials. Once logged in, they
        can easily view the homework assigned for the day. Other 
        students who have not yet signed up can create an account 
        to gain access to the website and conveniently see the 
        current homework tasks.
